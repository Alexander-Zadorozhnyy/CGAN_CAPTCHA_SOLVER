# Description

This is code for solving the text-based captchas based on the machine learning technologies. This approach is able to
achieve a higher success rate but requires significantly fewer real captchas because of using synthetic captcha
generator. Here we exposed only code without dataset that can run independently on your data for security reasons. Note
that it is not production ready. If you encounter any problems, please file an issue on GitHub.

## CAPTCHA image recognition

There are CAPTCHA that can be recognized by this solver. You can find some trained models in CNNModel.
